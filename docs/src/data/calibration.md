# Calibration

The disaggregation process retains the calibration from the WiNDC National model. This means calibration is not currently necessary at the regional level. Because of this, the calibration section is currently a placeholder for future information.

If you are in need of additional calibration (due to a custom disaggregation or other factors), please raise an issue on the [WiNDCRegional GitHub repository](https://github.com/uw-windc/WiNDCRegional.jl).
